# ü¶ñPrehistoric-calculatorü¶ñ

_What is the first thing to build when you start learning JavaScript? A calculator - evidently!<br>
Mine can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, that's why it is called "prehistoric"ü¶ñ or "antediluvian" ‚õàÔ∏è._
<br><br>
Prehistoric-calculator is a Java-Script training project created on 13th week of learning with [ITGirlSchool].

The task was to make a page that:
- on button press, asks user's name and alert with personal welcome-message
- has a simple 4-button calculator that requests 2 numbers and, on action choice, calculates the result
